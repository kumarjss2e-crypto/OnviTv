# Authentication Persistence Fix

## Problem
Users were being logged out and forced to go through onboarding every time they reopened the app, even though they had already logged in.

## Root Causes
1. **No Auth Persistence**: Firebase Auth wasn't configured to persist authentication state
2. **No Onboarding State**: App didn't remember if user had seen onboarding
3. **No Auth Check in Splash**: SplashScreen always navigated to Onboarding, ignoring auth state

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Firebase Auth Persistence
**File**: `src/config/firebase.js`

Added AsyncStorage-based persistence to Firebase Auth:
```javascript
import AsyncStorage from '@react-native-async-storage/async-storage';
import { initializeAuth, getReactNativePersistence } from 'firebase/auth';

auth = initializeAuth(app, {
  persistence: getReactNativePersistence(AsyncStorage)
});
```

**What this does:**
- Saves auth tokens to device storage
- Automatically restores user session on app restart
- Works offline

### 2. Onboarding State Persistence
**File**: `src/screens/SplashScreen.js`

Added AsyncStorage to remember if user has seen onboarding:
```javascript
// Save when user completes onboarding
await AsyncStorage.setItem('hasSeenOnboarding', 'true');

// Check on app start
const hasSeenOnboarding = await AsyncStorage.getItem('hasSeenOnboarding');
```

### 3. Smart Navigation Flow
**File**: `src/screens/SplashScreen.js`

SplashScreen now checks auth state and navigates accordingly:

```
App Start → SplashScreen
    ↓
Check Auth State
    ↓
┌───────────────┬────────────────┬──────────────┐
│ User Logged   │ Seen Onboarding│ First Time   │
│ In            │ Not Logged In  │ User         │
│ ↓             │ ↓              │ ↓            │
│ Main App      │ Login Screen   │ Onboarding   │
└───────────────┴────────────────┴──────────────┘
```

## New User Flow

### First Time User
1. Opens app → SplashScreen
2. No auth, no onboarding flag
3. Shows "Continue" button
4. Clicks Continue → Onboarding
5. Completes onboarding → Login/Signup
6. Logs in → Main App

### Returning User (Logged In)
1. Opens app → SplashScreen
2. Detects auth token
3. Auto-navigates to Main App (2 second delay for smooth transition)
4. **No onboarding, no login required!**

### Returning User (Logged Out)
1. Opens app → SplashScreen
2. No auth, but has seen onboarding
3. Auto-navigates to Login Screen
4. Logs in → Main App

## Dependencies Added
- `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage` - For persistent storage

## Testing

### Test Scenario 1: Fresh Install
1. Install app
2. Should show SplashScreen with "Continue" button
3. Click Continue → Onboarding
4. Complete flow and login
5. Close app completely
6. Reopen app
7. ✅ Should go directly to Main App (no onboarding, no login)

### Test Scenario 2: Logout
1. From Main App, logout
2. Close app
3. Reopen app
4. ✅ Should go directly to Login Screen (skip onboarding)

### Test Scenario 3: Clear Data
1. Clear app data/cache
2. Reopen app
3. ✅ Should show SplashScreen with "Continue" button (like fresh install)

## Files Modified
1. `src/config/firebase.js` - Added auth persistence
2. `src/screens/SplashScreen.js` - Added auth check and navigation logic
3. `package.json` - Added AsyncStorage dependency

## Benefits
✅ Users stay logged in between sessions
✅ Onboarding only shown once
✅ Smooth user experience
✅ Offline auth support
✅ Proper navigation flow
✅ No more repeated login/onboarding

## Notes
- Auth tokens are stored securely in device storage
- Tokens persist even if app is closed
- Users can still manually logout
- Clearing app data will reset everything (expected behavior)
